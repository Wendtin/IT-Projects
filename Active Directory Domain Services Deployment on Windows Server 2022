## **Objective**

- **Implement centralized authentication and identity management** (ensure that all users and computers are managed from the single domain controller)
- **Organize users and resources efficiently** (create organizational units [OUs] and groups to simplify permissions and administration)
- **Enhance security and access tools** (apply policies to enforce password complexity, account lockouts, and resource access restrictions)
- **Enable network-wide services integration (**Integrate DNS, DHCP, and Group Policy to streamline network management.)
- **Develop practical IT administration skills (**Learn how to deploy, configure, and maintain a core enterprise service.)

***Problems Solved***

1. **Scattered user and computer management (**Without AD, admins have to manage users individually on each machine. AD centralizes this.)
2. **Weak or inconsistent security policies (**AD + GPO enforces consistent security settings (password rules, account lockout, restricted access)).
3. **Difficulty in managing network resources (**Shared folders, printers, and applications can be difficult to control without AD.)
4. **Complexity in scaling networks (**In growing companies, manually adding users and configuring systems becomes unmanageable. AD allows scalable management.)
5. **Lack of integration between network services (**DHCP, DNS, file shares, and printers need a central authority for proper coordination — AD solves this.)

***Importance in a Real IT Environment***

- **Enterprise standard:** AD is the backbone of IT infrastructure in almost all medium to large organizations.
- **Security & compliance:** Centralized authentication ensures sensitive data is protected and auditable.
- **Efficiency:** IT teams can manage hundreds or thousands of users and devices from one console.
- **Scalability:** New users, computers, and services can be added quickly without disrupting operations.
- **Foundation for other services:** Services like Exchange, SharePoint, RDS, and PKI rely on Active Directory for identity and access management.

- Step 1: [Description + Screenshot]
- Step 2: [Description + Screenshot]
- Step 3: [Description + Screenshot]
    
    *(Write steps like a guide — this proves you actually did it.)*

## 3. **Configuration & Testing**

- Key settings (e.g., DHCP scope 192.168.10.100–200)
- Test results (e.g., Client received IP from DHCP, DNS resolved domain name, GPO applied successfully)
    
    *(Screenshots of successful tests are critical here.)*

## 4. **Challenges & Troubleshooting**

- Problems you faced (e.g., “DNS service didn’t start”)
- How you solved them (e.g., “Checked event logs, reconfigured zone delegation”)
    
    *(This shows problem-solving skills recruiters value.)*

## 5. **Outcome & Results**

- Final state of the system (e.g., “Users authenticated through AD, GPO enforced password policies, file shares restricted by group permissions”)
- Diagram (network or infrastructure overview)

## 6. **Conclusion & Next Steps**

- What you learned
- How this applies to a real company
- Future improvements (e.g., “Could integrate with Azure AD” or “Add monitoring with Windows Admin Center”)
